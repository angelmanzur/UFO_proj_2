UFO Predictions

Dataset: http://www.nuforc.org/index.html 

Hypothesis questions:
* How do the ufo shapes compare between 1960s vs 2000s? Does a certain shape last longer in 1960s vs now? 
* How different are the durations between shapes?
* How does CA vs DC metro area differ in terms of number of sightings?
* What is the difference between the population and number of sightings? 
* Is there a difference between the number of sightings per population for a specific region for specific year/decade? 
* How do the different shapes vary in duration between states? 

Steps:
1. Web scraping the site to get all data. (done)
2. Clean data and visualize the data. (done?)
3. Create database and save as ufo.bd file in python. (Wednesday)
4. Perform predictions such as t-test. (Wednesday)
5. Create Powerpoint (Thursday)
6. Project Due (Friday)
